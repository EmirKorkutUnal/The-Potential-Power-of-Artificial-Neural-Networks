<h1>The Potential Power of Artificial Neural Networks</h1>
A report about the power of Artifical Neural Networks and how they compare with Linear Regression, Generalized Additive Models, and Polynomial Regression.
<h2>Brief Description</h2>
Since it's not my style to write complex descriptions which also would bore me, I'm going to keep this part short.<br>
<b>Artifical Neural Networks</b> is the name given to a method use for modeling data. Just like any other data modeling method, you can train an ANN to make predictions.<br><br>
Your input goes through a series of <b>"hidden layers"</b> to create an output. Unlike most other models, the evaluation and interpretation processes of variables use changing weights; this is why these models are called <b>"Black box models"</b> - because you don't precisely know what's going on inside your hidden layers. The limits for the changing variable weights can be found out, but the exact way to evaluate and calculate each output remains a mystery.<br><br>
Let's see the potential power of these models compared to other methods.
<h2>DISCLAIMER</h2>
<b>Each and every dataset has its own unique characteristics. Remember, what works for your data is best for your data - you don't always need a more complicated model than you already have.</b>
<h2>Methodology</h2>
<h3>Data</h3>
On this article, we'll go through a dataset that contains features of various diamonds. The categorical variables can be turned into interval variables which makes our job easier. You can download this Kaggle dataset <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/shivam2503/diamonds/downloads/diamonds.zip/1">here</a>.
<h3>Models</h3>
Alongside ANN, some other methods are used to create a model based on the dataset. These are:<br>
<ul>
  <li><b>Linear Regression</b>: A model that tries to fit linear lines through your predictor and target variables. A relatively simple but effective tool.</li>
  <li><b>Generalized Additive Models</b>: A model that </li>
  <li><b>Polynomial Regression</b></li>
</ul>
